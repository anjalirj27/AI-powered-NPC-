ðŸ§  Project Overview: AI NPC Terminal
ðŸŽ® What's This All About?
AI NPC Terminal is a fun, interactive tool where users can roleplay with AI-powered characters, much like talking to Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in video games. But hereâ€™s the twist â€” it supports real-time voice input, voice output, multiple languages, and works both in the browser and command line.

Whether you want to get advice from a Wise Wizard, chat with a Cyborg Hacker, or hear stories from a Village Elder, this app makes it all possible â€” powered by cutting-edge AI and speech tools.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights
Multilingual: Chat in English, Hindi, or Bengali.

Voice-enabled: Speak your message instead of typing.

Voice response: NPCs talk back with generated speech!

Character-driven: Each NPC has a unique tone and personality.

Web + CLI: Accessible via a slick Streamlit UI or the command-line.

ðŸš€ How It Works (Simplified Flow)
User chooses NPC and language via the UI

User speaks or types a message

The app uses Whisper to transcribe voice (if used)

The message is sent to Groq's LLM, which replies in character

The reply is converted to speech using gTTS

pygame plays the voice â€” the NPC talks!
